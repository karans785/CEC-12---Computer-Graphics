OVERVIEW:

This program uses Cohen Sutherland Algo to clip a line according to a clipping window.
This program has a clipping window and two test cases.

In the first case line lies completely inside the clipping window hence no need of clipping.
In the second case line lies partly inside the clipping window and hence is clipped!

INSTRUCTIONS: 

1. Kindly click on the .exe file (application)  ellipse.exe .
2. Firstly the first test case is shown and you will have to press any key to clip the line(change the color of line from RED to YELLOW) indicating the clipping.
3. Second test case will appear (in a second )and again press any key to clip the line. The portion lying inside the clipping window will get changed to Yellow color.


Thank you!
